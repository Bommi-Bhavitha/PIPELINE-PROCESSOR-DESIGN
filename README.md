Description: 


The objective of this project is to design and simulate a 4-stage pipelined processor capable of executing basic instructions such as ADD, SUB, and LOAD. Pipelining is a key concept in modern processor design that allows multiple instructions to be processed simultaneously at different stages, significantly improving throughput and performance. This project demonstrates the implementation of a simplified pipelined architecture, enabling instruction-level parallelism by dividing instruction execution into four distinct stages.

The first stage is the Instruction Fetch (IF) stage, where the processor fetches the instruction from memory using the Program Counter (PC). The second stage, Instruction Decode (ID), decodes the fetched instruction and reads the required operands from the register file. The third stage, Execute (EX), carries out the required arithmetic or logical operation using the Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU). The final stage, Memory/Write Back (MEM/WB), handles memory access for LOAD instructions and writes results back to the register file.

This design will be developed using a Hardware Description Language (HDL) such as Verilog. A complete testbench will simulate the flow of multiple instructions through each stage of the pipeline. The simulation results will clearly show how each instruction progresses through the pipeline over time, and how different stages operate concurrently once the pipeline is filled. The project aims to not only verify functional correctness but also to illustrate key concepts like instruction overlap, pipeline latency, and data hazards.

The final deliverable includes a working Verilog implementation of the 4-stage pipelined processor, along with simulation outputs that trace the operation of each instruction across all pipeline stages. This project provides a foundational understanding of pipelined architecture, preparing students for more advanced topics such as hazard detection, forwarding, and branch prediction in modern processor design.
